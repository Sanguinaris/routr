## Introduction

### Document Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the [specification](./SPECS.md) are to be interpreted as described
in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### Purpose

This document aims to present a detailed description of the SIP Server *Routr*. It will explain the purpose and features
of the system, the interfaces of the system, what the system will do, the constraints under which it must operate, and
how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for the system's stakeholders and developers.

### Scope of Project

This software system will be a SIP Server that cares for the signaling as a standalone system or as part of a broader one. The specification aims for a design that maximizes scalability and extensibility. It uses a microservice architecture which was a challenging factor on **v1**.

We will use a microservice architecture to ensure that portions of the system can be deployed independently and treated according to its problem domain.

More specifically, this system will be designed to allow for the separation of concerns within the logical components of
a SIP Server. The software MUST be able to accept SIP Messages via *UDP*, *TCP*, *TLS*, *WS*, and *WSS*. It should transform the messages efficiently and facilitate communication between the various components.

Furthermore, the system MUST include a mechanism to replace the SIP Message processing without updating the entire system. It should also facilitate communication with external systems for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) and allow to host of multiple tenants by using a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) system.

The SIP Server "Routr" has three main components and one cooperating service. The first component, the EdgePort, is
responsible for accepting SIP Messages, parsing them into protobuf, and sending them to the Message Dispatcher. After a
SIP Message is processed, and the EdgePort will forward the SIP Message to the next hop.

The job of *Message Dispatcher* is to accept SIP Messages encapsulated as protobuf from the EdgePort, and route the
SIP Message to and from the Message Processor.

*Message Processor(s)* is responsible for the authentication, validation, and processing of SIP Messages. They are also
in charge of updating the SIP Messages to reach their destination.

*Middleware(s)* are optional components that cooperate to bring pluggable behaviors to the service. Middlewares may be
configured to modify requests (e.g., RTPEngine Middleware) or read them for observability.

**Brief Description**

The EdgePort component is a service that sits at the network's edge. The job of the EdgePort is to receive SIP Messages,
convert them to protobuf and forward them downstream for processing. A *Routr* network might have multiple EdgePorts.

**Functional Requirements**

The following functions are essential for an implementation of an *EdgePort*:

- *Accept SIP Msg* - Accept Messages using transport UDP, TCP, TLS, WS, and WSS
- *Accept SIP Msg (Part2)* - Accept Messages on some or all network interfaces
- *Transform SIP Msg* - Transform Messages to protobuf
- *Keep Msg's state* - MUST keep the state until the message is processed or a timeout occurs
- *Reject Msgs from banned IPs* - MUST have a mechanism to identify and discard unwanted Messages
- *Health Check* - MUST have a mechanism to identify the health of the service
- *M.E.L.T* - Must be capable of collecting and sending M.E.L.T to external systems
- *Service Port* - The ports for SIP signaling will default to traditional values (e.g., 5060, 5061, etc.)

**Non-functional Requirements**

The following requirements are essential to have for an implementation of an *EdgePort*:

- *Transformation Time* - Msg transformation time efficiency should be < *TBT*
- *Msg Processed/second* - Should be able to process *TBT* number of Msg per second
- *Recoverability* - Recover from an unhealthy state

**Service Configuration**

The configuration for the *EdgePort* could be represented as JSON or YAML formats. However, internal use and validation will use [https://json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step). The following example summarizes de configuration REQUIRED by the *EdgePort*:

```json

**Communication with Adjacent Services**

Adjacent to the *EdgePort* is the *Message Dispatcher*. The communication between these two services is done using gRPC
and protobuf.

<details>
<summary>Message Proto</summary>

```proto 
... 
 
message SIPMessage {
  oneof message_type {
    ResponseType response_type = 1;
    SipURI request_uri = 2;
  }
  From from = 3;
  To to = 4;
  Contact contact = 5;
  CallID call_id = 6;
  ContentLength content_length = 7;
  Expires expires = 8;
  WWWAuthenticate www_authenticate = 9;
  MaxForwards max_forwards = 10;
  Authorization authorization = 11;
  repeated Extension extensions = 12;
  repeated Via via = 13;
  repeated Route route = 14;
  repeated RecordRoute record_route = 15;
  string reason_phrase = 16;
  string body = 17;
}
 
...
```

</details>

**Test Criteria**

The *EdgePort* MUST pass all the tests prescribed in chapter *1.x* of the `SIP Connect v1.1`. Additionally, the *
EdgePort* MUST pass the following tests:

1. Routing INVITE messages for SIP Clients located at separate *EdgePorts*
2. Signaling for popular WebRTC clients

**Security Considerations**

Since the *EdgePort* sits at the edge of the network, it must be capable of withstanding typical SIP attacks. On SIP
over TCP or TLS, the server should avoid descriptors resource exhaustion, especially during a SIP INVITE flood attack.
Consider monitoring and alerting for CPU and memory usage needed to handle SIP sessions and dialog, staying within the
resources available. Finally, the server should drop any malformed SIP messages and avoid filling up the log files or
logging servers.

**Special Considerations**

Running the *EdgePort* in a cloud environment like Kubernetes can be challenging. Keep the following in mind when
deploying to Kubernetes:

1. Kubernetes' load balancers are not designed to work with SIP
2. The EdgePort uses the SIP protocol, which requires L7 load balancers
3. A complex network topology could disrupt the service and create latency

**Brief Description**

The *Message Dispatcher* component takes a SIP message and forwards them to the corresponding Message Processor. The the matching process is done using the request from the *EdgePort*.

The *Message Dispatcher* will always use the first Processor that matches a request. If no match is found for the given request, the server MUST respond with a `SIP 405: Method Not Allowed.` The *Message Dispatcher* component does not manipulate the SIP Messages.

**Functional Requirements**

The following functions are MUST have for an implementation of a *Message Dispatcher*:

- *Stateless Service* - The service must be built in such a way to allow for scalability
- *Accept gRPC Requests* - Accept gRPC Requests
- *Find Processor* - Find a processor that matches a given request
- *Forward Requests using gRPC* - Send the requests to the corresponding *Message Processor*
- *Return processed Message* - Routes the processed message back to the *EdgePort*
- *Health Check* - MUST have a mechanism to identify the health of the service
- *M.E.L.T* - Must be capable of collecting and sending M.E.L.T to external systems
- *System Unavailable* - It must return a `SIP 503 Service Unavailable` if the matched *Message Processor* is
  unreachable
- *Service Port* - The default gRPC port at the Message Dispatcher SHOULD be `51901`

**Non-functional Requirements**

The following requirements are essential to have for an implementation of a *Message Dispatcher*:

- *Msg Processed/second* - Should be able to process *TBT* number of Msg per second
- *Recoverability* - Recover from an unhealthy state

**Service Configuration**

``` 

</details>

**Communication with Adjacent Services**

The adjacent services of the *Message Dispatcher* are the *EdgePort* and the *Message Processor*. The communication with all adjacent services is done with gRPC and protobuf. The `processor.proto` contains the following code:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package fonoster.routr.processor.v2beta1;

// Processor service
service Processor {
  // Process Message Request
  rpc ProcessMessage (MessageRequest) returns (MessageResponse) {}
}
```

The *Message Dispatcher* expects that *Message Procesor(s)* have the same interface.

**Test Criteria**

MUST have Unit Tests to validate its basic functionalities. MUST have Integration Tests with all Adjacent Services.

**Special Considerations**

None

### Message Processor

**Brief Description**

Message Processors are small services that carry the logic to manipulate SIP Messages.

**Functional Requirements**

A processor will be responsible for one or more of the following tasks:

1. Authenticate Message
2. Authorize Message
3. Validate Message
4. Process Message

Interface Pseudocode:

=> Message Processor Matched (by Message Dispatcher)
  => isValid (message) or return Bad Request (400) 
  => isAuthenticated(message) or send Authentication Challenge
  => isAuthorized(message) or send is Unauthorized
  => doProcess(message) and return updated request/response
```

> The default gRPC port at the Message Processor SHOULD be `51901`.

**Non-functional Requirements**

The following requirements are essential to have to a *Message Processor*:

- *Msg Processed/second* - Should be able to process *TBT* number of Msg per second
- *Recoverability* - Recover from an unhealthy state

**Service Configuration**

Each Message Processor can have its own configuration based on the use case.

However, the following "base" configuration is recommended as the starting point for your Processor's design.

```json
{
  "kind": "Processor",
  "apiVersion": "v2beta1",
  "ref": "logging-processor",
  "metadata": {
    "region": "us-east1"
  },
  "spec": {
    "bindAddr": "0.0.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Communication with Adjacent Services**

Adjacent to the *Message Processor* is the *Message Dispatcher*. The communication flows from the *Message Dispatcher* to the *Message Processor*, where the *Message Processor* is the server and *Message Dispatcher* is the client. A *Message Processor* MUST have the following protobuf interface:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package fonoster.routr.processor.v2beta1;

// Processor service
service Processor {
  // Process Message Request
  rpc ProcessMessage (MessageRequest) returns (MessageResponse) {}
}
```

**Test Criteria**

Message Processor SHOULD have Unit Testing for all its core functionalities.

**Security Consideration**

None.

### Location Service

**Brief Description**

The Location Service(LS) stores routing information for all participating endpoints. A Processor can later retrieve the route and learn how to reach the endpoint.

The proto definition for the LS route includes all necessary information to reach a target endpoint, including the `host`, `port` `transport`, and ingress `listening_point.`

Suppose an endpoint participating as "backend" wishes to use the `least-sessions` balancing algorithm. In that case, it must report the number of active sessions using the `session_count` field. The session count could come in the form of a header (e.g.: `X-Session-Count`).

> For a complete picture of the routing, the `listening_point` of the originating endpoint must be taken into account.
> This information is present on all requests arriving at a Processor.

Route DTO:

```proto
// A binding created by an actual endpoint (Softphone, PBX, Conference System, etc.)
message Route {
  string user = 1;
  string host = 2;
  string port = 3;
  fonoster.routr.common.v2beta1.Transport transport = 4;
  int64 registered_on = 5;
  int32 expires = 6;
  int32 session_count = 7;
  string edge_port_ref = 8;
  repeated fonoster.routr.processor.v2beta1.NetInterface listening_points = 9;
  repeated string localnets = 10;
  repeated string external_addrs = 11;
  // During route creation, an endpoint can request to add labels than can later be
  // used as selectors. For example, a Softphone can add a label `priority=1` to indicate
  // that it is the prefered endpoint for the given AOR.
  map<string, string> labels = 12;
}
```

**Functional Requirements**

The following functions are MUST have for an implementation of a *Location Service*:

- *Stateless Service* - The service must be built in such a way as to allow for scalability
- *Accept gRPC Requests* - Accept gRPC Requests
- *Find Routes* - Find all the routes to an endpoint
- *Filtering Labels* - MUST be able to store endpoints using labels (for filtering)
- *Backend or Endpoint* - MUST allow AOR the "sip:" and "backend:" schemes
- *Balancing Algorithm* - Implements `round-robin` and `least-sessions`
- *Session Affinity* - Implements session base affinity
- *Cache* - Caching must be done via "providers" that are easily replaceable (e.g.: `Memory`, `Redis`, etc.)
- *Health Check* - MUST have a mechanism to identify the health of the service
- *M.E.L.T* - Must be capable of collecting and sending M.E.L.T to external systems
- *Service Port* - The default gRPC port at the Location Service SHOULD be `51902`

**Non-functional Requirements**

The following requirements are essential to have for an implementation of a *Location Service*:

- *Msg Processed/second* - Should be able to process *TBT* number of Msg per second
- *Recoverability* - Recover from an unhealthy state

**Service Configuration**

Example:

```json
{
  "kind": "Location",
  "apiVersion": "v2beta1",
  "metadata": {
    "region": "us-east1"
  },
  "spec": {
    "bindAddr": "0.0.0.0:51902",
    "cache": {
      "provider": "memory"
    }
  }
}
```

> Notice that using the `memory` provider will only work for simple cases where you run a single instance of the Location Service. 
> Suppose you need the `least-session` algorithm and run multiple instances of the Location Service. In such cases, you will need a distributed provider such as `Redis.`
